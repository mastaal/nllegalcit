# nllegalcit

Python library to find citations to Dutch legal documents in natural language text.

This library is partially based on the [linkextractor](https://gitlab.com/koop/ld/lx/linkextractor) developed by [KOOP](https://www.koopoverheid.nl/) to implement the Linked Data Overheid (LiDO). The aim of `nllegalcit` is to provide a more generally accessible way to recognize Dutch legal citations in natural language text.

**Please note that this library is currently under development. It will probably not work reliably.**
